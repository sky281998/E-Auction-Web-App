# Description of the project
1. Users can create an account on the site and and able to login into their account.
2. The user’s proLile should contain at least an email and their date of birth.
3. Users should be able to post a new item for auction. Items should contain a title, a
description, a picture and the date/time the auction Linishes.
4. Users of the site should then be able to bid for an item, before the end date/time of
that item.
5. At the end of the auction, the highest bidder is able to “buy” the item. You do not need
to implement the “payment” process.
6. The site must contain a page listing all the items that are currently available, with the
ability for “search” for items based on a given keyword. 
7. a page containing “closed” auctions, detailing the list of biddings, and the winner.
8. The frontend should uses Bootstrap.
9. Users are able to send questions to the item owner about the condition of the item, and the owner is able to reply to those questions.
10) Users are able to reset their password, in case they have forgotten it. This would be done via a “reset password link” sent to their email.
